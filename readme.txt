ExtProtect - Extrarius's Warcraft 3 Map Protector Version 0.1.2.0ÃŸ

New versions will be available for download at http://extprotect.psychosanity.com/

Please Send Information On Any Bugs To ExtProtect@PsychoSanity.com

==============
 Instructions
==============

1) Run ExtProtect.exe

2) Click on the ... button by the Map Name box to select a map to protect.

3) Type your password into the Password box.

4) Type it again in the confirm box to make sure you didn't make any typos.

5) Click on the ... button by the Save As box to choose where to save the modified map.

6) Click the button labeled "Protect" or "UnProtect" to do it.


While it is protecting/unprotecting, the status box between the about
and protect/unprotect button will say "Protecting" or "UnProtecting".
When the operation is complete, it will say "Done". If there was an
error and the operation couldn't be completed, it will display the
word "Error".

*Note: If the button says "Not A Map" or "No Backup", you can't modify the map
       because its either not a valid warcraft 3 map or it wasnt protected with
       ExtProtect and doesn't have a backup stored inside the map.


=========
 Options
=========

After running the program for the first time, it will create a file called
ExtProtect.ini that contains some settings. Two of the settings you don't
need to mess with - they store the last used filenames, but two others you
might want to change.

If you like typing in the filename instead of using the browse box you can
change "ReadOnlyFileNames" to false.

Also, you can change "WarnNoBackup" to false and the program won't warn you
anymore that leaving the password fields blank means no backup is stored.
